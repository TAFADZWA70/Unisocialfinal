                <h2>📖 Our Story</h2>
                <p>
                    As a first-year student, I experienced a blend of fear and curiosity about university life. My initial research primarily yielded vlogs featuring students in cafés, which provided little insight into what to expect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Upon arriving at university, I found myself feeling completely lost and overwhelmed by the unfamiliar environment. As an introvert, I struggled to make friends and connect with others. Additionally, I faced challenges with my programming modules. The university setting is bustling with students, yet seeking help can be daunting, as it is often unclear what others are studying.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This realization inspired the concept of <strong>UniSocial</strong>: a platform designed to support students in feeling valued and connected. UniSocial aims to facilitate academic assistance, foster social interactions, and create a nurturing community where students can thrive together.

                <h2>🎯 Our Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    University can be a challenging experience, and many students struggle to **fit in, pass their courses, and build meaningful connections**. At UniSocial, we aim to change that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our mission is to create an **inclusive and supportive** environment where students can **thrive both academically and socially**. We help students:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>📚 **Excel in their studies** through academic resources and peer support</li>
                    <li>🤝 **Make new friends** and build lasting connections</li>
                    <li>🎓 **Adapt to university life** with guidance and mentoring</li>
                    <li>💡 **Feel comfortable** in a community that values them</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    No student should feel alone in their university journey. With **UniSocial**, you’ll find the support, friends, and tools you need to succeed.
